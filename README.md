# ‚úè Intro

This is a very simple repo that can be used to organize your Downloads folder! To customize what file extension goes into which folder, configure the `config.json` file. The keys will be the folder names and the list of values are the file extensions that will go into that folder

# ‚¨á Install

You can store this repo folder anywhere on your file directory (even in your Downloads folder üòè). You can either download the entire folder by clicking [here](https://github.com/Johandielangman/downloads_organizer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzipping the folder, or you can clone it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Johandielangman/downloads_organizer.git
```

# üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Organizer

To run it, open the `downloads_organizer` file in a terminal and run it using Python3

```shell
python3 main.py
```

That should be it! Enjoy!
